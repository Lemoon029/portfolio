<!---Introduction--->
    <p>Hello, I'm Lemoon! I'm a novice coder (that's being generous) getting their feet wet. Apologies for the crudeness of this website! I like lemons and tea!</p>
<!---Bibliography-->
    <p>I was born sometime after 1999--so I missed that party--and sometime before 2020--so I didn't miss that "party" ):. My coding journey started with the site Scratch which I made a couple of neat things with it (if you think this website is primitive, those projects are pre-stone age). Scratch doesn't teach an official coding language though as it uses Block Coding. I still believe it is a good spot for someone to first learn the very basics of coding as long as they understand how it is different. If you're curious about Scratch I left a look to it in my "resume".</p>

      <p>I have been using HTML and CSS code for about 3 months now and I am finally moving on to using Github to put my projects on the web. Depending on the state you see this site, my quote-an-quote resume may need some major reworking. Now for the important details about me, my actual name is obviously not Lemoon. It is the Lemoon029. I spend way too much time thinking if I'd rather meet a lEmon dEmon or a lemOn demOn. My favorite ice cream brand is tillamook. Over my entire life time I am likely going to own a total of 2 cats, two calicos and a tabby. My eventual death will likely take place sometime during the Fall of 2041. Cause: Either a snow storm or falling piano.</p>
