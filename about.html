        <!---Introduction--->
        <p class="bubble">Hello, I'm Lemoon! I'm a novice coder (and that's being generous) that is still getting their feet wet. Apologies for the crudeness of this website! I really like lemons and tea.</p>
        <!---Bibliography-->
        <h2>Bibliography</h2>
        <p class="sub-title">I was born sometime after 1999--so I missed that party--and sometime before 2020--so I didn't miss that "party". My coding journey started with the site Scratch which I made a couple of neat things with it (if you think this website is primitive, those projects are pre-stone age). Scratch doesn't teach an official coding language though as it uses Block Coding. I still believe it is a good spot for someone to first learn the very basics of coding as long as they understand how it is different. If you're curious about Scratch I left a link to it in my "resume" (link is at the bottom of this page).</p>

            <p class="sub-title">I have been using HTML and CSS code for about 3 months now and I am finally moving on to using Github to put my projects on the web. Depending on the state you see this site, my quote-an-quote resume may need some major reworking. Now for the important details about me, my actual name is obviously not Lemoon. It is the Lemoon029. I spend way too much time thinking if I'd rather meet a lemOn demOn or a lEmon dEmon. My favorite ice cream brand is tillamook. Over my entire life time I am likely going to own a total of 3 cats (not necessarily at the same time), two calicos and a tabby. According to a wiki, my death will take place sometime during the Fall of 2041. The cause is going to be either a snow storm or falling piano but I can't remember which one it was.</p>
