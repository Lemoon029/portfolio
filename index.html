                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This is a fan-made website by a fan of the series World Trigger. The goal of this site is to give a simple and quick way for other World Trigger fans to overview all of the currently known Triggers. As of now, this site only covers most of the main offensive triggers of the 3 main factions: Border, Aftokrator, and Galopoula. Hopefully, someday the scope of this site will expand to cover all of the sub-triggers as well as even trion soldiers.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-title"> Border Triggers</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Triggers used by the organization of Border on Earth. Border triggers are different from most typical neighbor triggers as they are custom constructed with an arrangement of multiple main and sub-trigger abilities, rather than based around one main trigger function such as black triggers. As such, a physical trigger carried by a Border Agent is likely to have multiple of the trigger functions listed below.</p>
            <div class="section-text">Each trigger function is also mass-produced and designed to be usable by people of different skill level, unlike specialized neighbor triggers that require specific training for an individual to use their trigger.</div>

As a result, it is not very sturdy. One of the most versatile triggers out there.

Raygust is quite heavy.

            <p class="section-text2">Aftokrator is commonly seen as the most powerful nation in the Neighborhood. It is also referred to as "the Holy Land". Their triggers take advantage of horn technology that enchances the trion of their soldiers. As a result their triggers tend to be much more powerful than typical triggers.</p>

A very versatile trigger.</div>

The exact limits and rules of where and how far portals can be placed are currently unknown, but it is fairly versatile. The user can also create portals that summon spikes that quickly stab outwards.</div>

This can be used in many ways including offensively as the user can turn parts of their body into deadly spikes. Any damage to the body has near no effect as the users form can simply be put back together again. The user can also harden their body beyond normal. The only weakness the user has is their essential trion organs (but these can be moved any where within the body. </div>

Appears like a cane when active; however, it can be opened revealing itself to actually be a concealed sword. It can create giant spinning rings around the user with huge swords attached.
